###TODO
* Figure out how to automatically calculate how many ticks corresponds to a 64th note (currently hardcoded for the file I'm working with)
* Import file and whatever else from command line argument (currently hardcoding path)
* Specify drum tracks so you can export notes to different channels
* Probably should do better error handling
